short-medium term:
 ☐ IRC gateway

 ☐ messaging a group of users, like everybody with a given flair - this transposes “multiple” channels onto a single one, could work fine
 ☐ multiple channels (and the ui for it) if we still want it after the messaging a group of users thing
 ☐ google moderator like functionality where the chat goes into a voting mode where you post your question and others vote it up to be asked, no idea how this should work
